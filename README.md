# A collection of Proximus demo apps

Proximus is Aerospike's vector database solution. Here you will find apps (we
currently only have one) that showcase cool applications of Proximus.

1. [Prism](prism-image-search/)

    - A web server application that imports images and allows you to search them
      using sentences.
2. [Basic Search](./basic-search)
    - A simple python application that demonstrates vector ANN index creation, vector record insertion and basic ANN
      query against Proximus server, using the python client.
