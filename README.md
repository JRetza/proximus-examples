# About Proximus
Proximus is Aerospike's vector search solution. 

This repo provides example apps for building apps using Proximus to perform vector
search. Vectors allows you to combine machine learning models, like ChatGPT, CLIP,
Llama, etc. to build applications that leverage these models AI capabilities. This means
you can encode meaning from text, images, video, etc and search across a large dataset.
This can be used for a variety of applications such as semantic search, recommendation systems,
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) apps and more. For more about leveraging Vector Embeddings
see the [OpenAI Docs about vector embedding use cases](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).
